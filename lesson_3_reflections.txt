When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?
  -if I work with multiple machines at different times
  -if I want to collaborate with other people
  -it's also a good way to back up my work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  -I might be working on something I don't want to release publicly to GitHub
   quite yet, and I want to be able to push my changes when I am ready.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?
  -forks: cloning from one GitHub repository to another GitHub repository.
  -clones: makes a copy of a repository to a local machine.
  -branches: making commits that aren't part of the main master log of 
   commits.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
  -easily reconcile differences between the last known and the actual state
   of the remote
  -the local will be able to easily see changes that have been made to the
   remote since the last pull
