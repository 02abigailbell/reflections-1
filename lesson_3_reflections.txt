When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?
  -if I work with multiple machines at different times
  -if I want to collaborate with other people
  -it's also a good way to back up my work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  -I might be working on something I don't want to release publicly to GitHub
   quite yet, and I want to be able to push my changes when I am ready.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?
  -forks: cloning from one GitHub repository to another GitHub repository.
  -clones: makes a copy of a repository to a local machine.
  -branches: making commits that aren't part of the main master log of 
   commits.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
  -easily reconcile differences between the last known and the actual state
   of the remote
  -the local will be able to easily see changes that have been made to the
   remote since the last pull

How would you collaborate without using Git or GiHub? What would be easier, 
and what would be harder?
  -git does a good job of keeping a stable public version of the project safe
   so developers can experiment with different features on their own while
   all working together on the same project at the same time. this can be very
   difficult without git.
  -one of the only downsides to using git is the inconvenience of constantly
   adding, committing, pulling, and pushing. but this keeps things secure and
   safe
