When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?
  -if I work with multiple machines at different times
  -if I want to collaborate with other people
  -it's also a good way to back up my work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  -I might be working on something I don't want to release publicly to GitHub
   quite yet, and I want to be able to push my changes when I am ready.
