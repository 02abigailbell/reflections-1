1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It turns the current directory into a git repository, applying the git
version control to the folder.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows git to commit specific files and not necessarily the
entire working directory. It is a temporary place to hold files before they
are committed.
