1. How did viewing a diff between two versions help you see the bug that was
introduced?

It highlights the differences between the versions and greatly narrows down 
where the bug could be.

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

It saves times whenever I want to go back to what I had before. Also, having 
a record ensures I never lose anything, regardless of if I think I
need it or not.
